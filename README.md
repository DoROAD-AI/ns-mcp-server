## Installation

You can install this server in three ways:

### 1. Using Claude Desktop with NPM Package

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ns-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "ns-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NS_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can get an API key from [NS API Portal](https://apiportal.ns.nl/)

### 2. Using Smithery

To install NS Travel Information Server automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/ns-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install ns-server --client claude
```

### 3. From Source

   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Add your NS API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   NS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

Then update your Claude configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ns-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/ns-server/build/index.js"
