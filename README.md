# NS Travel Information MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/ns-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/ns-server)

Transform your AI assistant into a Dutch railways expert! This MCP server connects Claude to real-time NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) travel information, making it your perfect companion for navigating the Netherlands by train.

## Real-World Use Cases

- "Is my usual 8:15 train from Almere to Amsterdam running on time?"
- "Are there any delays on the Rotterdam-Den Haag route today."
- "What's the best alternative route to Utrecht if there's maintenance on the direct line?"
- "Which train should I take to arrive at my office in Amsterdam Zuid before 9 AM?"
- "Which route to Amsterdam has the fewest transfers with a stroller?"
- "What's the earliest train I can take to make my 10 AM meeting in The Hague?"
- "Is there first class quiet workspace available on the Amsterdam to Rotterdam route?"
- "When's the last train back to Groningen after a night out in Amsterdam?"
- "Are there any weekend engineering works that might affect my Monday morning class?"
- "Are there OV-fiets bikes available at Utrecht Centraal for my afternoon meeting?"

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Add your NS API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   NS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   You can get an API key from [NS API Portal](https://apiportal.ns.nl/)

## Integration with Claude Desktop

To add this server to Claude Desktop, update your Claude configuration file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`) by adding the following to the `mcpServers` object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ns-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/ns-server/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NS_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to:
1. Replace `/path/to/ns-server` with the actual path to your installation
2. Add your NS API key in the `env` section

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.
